## SUMMARY
This project is intended to provide a basic framework for scraping images and videos from popular e-commerce websites.  Since the format of each website is different to suit branding and other design considerations, it is incumbent on the user of this framework to complete the functions for the target website and, if necessary, tailor the framework itself to function with that website.

To avoid loading of duplicate libraries, the framework is built in VanillaJS.

This code was conceived both as a study of HTML DOM manipulation and to assist sellers in extracting generic images for their own listings.
